/*Write a GraphicsProgram that draws a set of ten circles with different sizes, positions,
and colors. Each circle should have a randomly chosen color, a randomly chosen radius
between 5 and 50 pixels, and a randomly chosen position on the canvas, subject to the
condition that the entire circle must fit inside the canvas without extending past the edge. */
